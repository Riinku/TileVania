# Dungeon Crawler
 Purpose: To learn unity
 Small game where you must find the exit to the dungeons before the water level rises. Escape enimes and traverse traps to reach teh protal leading you out of the dungeon. 
 
 Implemented use of tiles and rule tiles to easily create an dungeon enviornment. Created enemies with basic Ai movement to patrol platforms and hazards such as deadly spikes and 
 water that rises during the level. 
 
 *Note: Game is not complete, only certain elements of a basic game are added for learning new things with unity*
